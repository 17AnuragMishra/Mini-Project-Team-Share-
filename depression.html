        <h3><b>Depression Online Help</b></h3>
        <p>Depression is a word that is widely used but less understood. It is often confused with <b>sadness, anxiety, phobia or stress</b>. <br>

            Sadness, feeling down, having a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities – these are symptoms familiar to all of us. But, if they persist and affect our life substantially, it may be depression. <br> Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistently low mood and a feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It is a persistent problem, not a passing one, lasting on <b>average 6 to 8 months</b>. <br>
            
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is the most common illness worldwide and the leading cause of disability. They estimate that 350 million people are affected by depression, globally. <br>
            
            Sometimes physical problems can cause depression. But other times, symptoms of depression are part of a more complex psychiatric problem.
